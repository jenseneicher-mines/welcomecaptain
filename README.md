Welcome Captain is a web based Space exploration game writen in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The game is comprised of several screens that you traverse through as you colect points while also learning about each planet.

The player can choose their own ship and move around the solar system in any order. They need to collect 4 data points on each planet and once they have gathered all 32 data points, they win. But everytime they move to a new planet the data points switch position and they have to look closely for them.

When exploring the solar system, the player also needs to be aware of the asteroids, as getting hit by one will cause you to lose the game.

Some cool CSS effects we used were making the data object images that you click for points only visible when you hover over them. The ship choosing page also has a cool effect of changing the border color. The button at the win screen also rotates around the y axis a couple times for some added flair.

# TODO
# add more here for what you had difficulty with
Things that were a bear to implement in the Javascript were making sure users could only get one point per data object, eg. they couldn't spam a data object and get all the points, they would instead have to visit every planet.

Finding properly formatted and high quality pictures for the surface of planets was difficult.
Using local storage and strings store all data for the facts seems a bit bulky and there might be a better way.
Formatting the explore pages with the positioning of the items was tedious.
